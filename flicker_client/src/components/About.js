            <p>With the maturation of streaming services there's a ton of movie and tv series content available to consume.  
                So much content in fact that it can be difficult to know where to start.  In addition it's always interesting
                to see what other people thought of a Flick you loved or hated.     
                That's the idea of Flicker.  We love sharing our thoughts on all kinds of movies and shows.  Reading other people's
                reviews can be fun in many ways.  So, check out what others are saying about your favorite flick and/or share
                your thoughts too!
