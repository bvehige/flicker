# Welcome to the Flicker App! üçøüé•

Flicker is a place for fans of movies, tv, and streaming shows.  It's a place where users can read, share, and discuss their thoughts and opinions about their favorite show.  You can search for movies or shows to write a review on, read what other people have reviewed, and leave comments to other reviewers in the spirit of good conversation.  This application was created using Ruby on Rails as an API on the backend and React-Redux in the frontend which is responsible for rendering & updating the DOM by making fetch requests to communicate with the Rails API in the backend.
